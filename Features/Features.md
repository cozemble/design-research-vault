#### Files

- There are 2 types of feature files:
	1. **Feature:** The main feature with it's description.
		- Must be located directly in /Features
		- Details should be split into _Feature Detail_ files
	2. **Feature Detail:** The complexities of a feature.
		- Can stack infinitely. 
		- Should be placed in a folder with the main _Feature_'s name.
- Use _Feature_ template on creating a new Features


Use the _Features Schema_ canvas to organize features in a single place to get the whole grasp of them easily. You can also create canvasses to display the details of one single feature.
